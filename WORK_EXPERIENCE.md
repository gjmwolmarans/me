# Some of my Work Experience
## Financial Provider
At a Financial Provider specializing in Life Insurance, I was part of a dynamic team responsible for maintaining both frontend and backend systems. These systems facilitated interactions between the company and approximately 3,000 active Financial Advisors.

## Remote Development Firm
As a remote Developer at a development firm, I handled various tasks including data processing, maintenance, and defect resolution. I played a crucial role in greenfield client projects, predominantly focusing on developing new mobile apps using Xamarin, C#, .NET, and MongoDB/SQL Server databases.

### Projects
#### Truck Road-Side Assistance
I spearheaded the development of a Xamarin app and an ASP.NET API backend in collaboration with a frontend developer. This project was designed to support a company's services for assisting truck drivers with vehicle breakdowns on South African roads. The app utilized the device's camera and GPS sensors to report incidents, and provided real-time updates to both truck owners and drivers when a service technician was dispatched.

#### Competition Data Preparation
For a prominent client in the cosmetic industry, I created an Excel tool to clean up MongoDB data from an online marketing competition. This project involved extensive data transformations and handling incomplete data entries due to changes in the frontend (data entry) during the competition.

I was deeply committed to our projects and often went above and beyond to meet deadlines and deliver quality results. This intense dedication, while driving substantial achievements, also led to periods of burnout. These experiences taught me valuable lessons about work-life balance and the importance of sustainable work practices.
