Growing up in a small rural town, I was fortunate to be introduced to computers and technology early on. That exposure led me to pursue a career in Software Engineering.

My Software Engineering path began with Pascal and Delphi, and I transitioned to Lazarus during university. For my C and C++ university modules, I initially used Code::Blocks before moving to Visual Studio, and eventually used QT for more advanced modules. Along the way, and outside of formal training, I’ve completed many books, courses, labs, and tutorials in Cloud, Data, DevOps, Desktop, Mobile, and Web technologies.

Earning 14 Microsoft certifications has been a key part of my journey, helping me stay on top of the latest trends and technologies. I love solving tough technical problems and building scalable systems, whether in DevOps, Data Engineering, or AI. Continuous learning is at the core of my approach.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, and balancing work with personal pursuits. I believe that achieving success requires professional, and personal balance, I’m always looking for ways to excel in both, and bring innovation to life.
